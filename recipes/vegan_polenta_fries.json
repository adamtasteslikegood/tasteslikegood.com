  "instructions": [
    "Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (220\u00b0C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "Carefully remove the polenta roll from its packaging and pat it dry with a paper towel. Slice the roll into fry shapes, about 1/2-inch thick.",
    "Place the sliced polenta into a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Gently toss until all the fries are lightly coated.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the nutritional yeast, garlic powder, smoked paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper.",
    "Sprinkle the seasoning mixture over the oiled polenta fries. Toss gently again to ensure the fries are evenly coated with the spices.",
    "Arrange the seasoned polenta fries on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer, making sure they are not touching. This helps them get crispy.",
    "Bake for 25-30 minutes, flipping the fries halfway through the cooking time, until they are golden brown and crispy on the edges.",
    "Remove from the oven and let them cool for a minute before serving. They will firm up slightly as they cool. Serve hot with your favorite dipping sauce."
  ],
  "notes": "For extra crispy fries, you can use an air fryer. Cook at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) for 15-20 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through. Serve with marinara sauce, vegan aioli, or ketchup. Feel free to experiment with other spices like onion powder, cayenne pepper, or dried rosemary.",
